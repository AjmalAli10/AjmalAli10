# 👋 Hi, I'm Ajmal Ali

Software Engineer building scalable systems, AI-powered platforms, and high-performance web applications.

I enjoy solving complex engineering problems and turning them into clean, maintainable, production-ready systems. My work sits at the intersection of system design, full-stack development, and practical AI integration.

---

## 🧠 What I Care About

- Designing systems that scale with product growth  
- Writing code that is clear, reliable, and maintainable  
- Integrating AI where it creates real value — not just novelty  
- Optimizing performance across frontend and backend layers  
- Taking ideas from requirements to production with ownership  

---

## 🚀 What I Work On

- Full-stack applications using React, Next.js, Node.js, and SQL  
- Configuration-driven architectures and internal platforms  
- AI-powered systems (RAG pipelines, semantic search, intelligent filtering)  
- Async workflows using queues, cron jobs, and event-driven patterns  
- Performance optimization and production reliability
